# Quantum Optics of the Electromagnetic Field - Class Project

This repository contains materials for the class project on Quantum Optics of the Electromagnetic Field.
The Final Project aim to be selecting a published paper, and continue on their researched work inspired by the work. Since it is just a class project, I have only done some preliminary work instead of a comperhensive project.

## Contents

- Final papers on Characterizing The Entanglement Depth
- Quantum states simulations
- - [Simulations](./simulations): Contains all simulation code and results.
